# daily_journal
 A journal for daily journalling. Easy to use with Day One JSON format.


Didn't like the fact that Day One switched to a subscription format. In the end it's just a journal. So I'm going to rebuild the basics and see if I can add some personal features I'd like.

JS got chosen because I hate it but after not using it for many years I don't remember why. Big chance there are improvements :)
